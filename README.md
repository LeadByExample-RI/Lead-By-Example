> **Note**: The `client_assets/` folder structure is tracked in git, but its contents (except documentation files) are ignored to protect client privacy and manage repository size. See `client_assets/README.md` for details about expected contents.

### Client Assets Management

The `client_assets/` folder is designed to store client-provided materials while maintaining privacy:

**What's tracked in git:**

- `README.md` - Documentation about the folder
- `.gitkeep` - Ensures folder structure is preserved
- `PLACEHOLDER.txt` - Instructions for client materials

**What's ignored (not tracked):**

- Client photos and images
- PDF documents (e.g., `Lead_By_Example.pdf`)
- Brand assets (logos, PSDs, AI files)
- Other client-provided files

**Why this approach?**

- 🔒 Protects client privacy
- 📦 Keeps repository size manageable
- 📁 Maintains consistent folder structure across clones
- 🔄 Easy to add client materials locally without affecting version control

**To add client materials:**

1. Place files in `client_assets/` folder
2. Files will be automatically ignored by git
3. Reference them when needed for development
4. Optimize and copy to `public/` for web use

📖 **See [docs/CLIENT_ASSETS_GUIDE.md](docs/CLIENT_ASSETS_GUIDE.md) for detailed management instructions.**
